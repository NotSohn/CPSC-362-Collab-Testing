    it should be 
    
    'git add ./HelloWorld.js'

    'git commit -m "intial commit" <-- Only writing this because this is the initial commit of the file, when commit this file again state what you changed -Justin 
    ('git status' to make sure that the file you commited is commited)

        EXAMPLE(This is how my terminal in wsl looks like): justin@DESKTOP-UT6G8TD:/mnt/c/Users/Justin Sohn/Github Repositories/CPSC-362-Collab-Testing$ git status
                                                            On branch main
                                                            Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
                                                            (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    
    
    'git push origin main'

    * If you're doing this thru wsl then you kinda have to go through a process to git push so i'm going to leave a link here for whoever is using wsl https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/message-support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal
